nottoomuch
==========

misc material i use with notmuch mail indexer


introduction
------------

my personal “extensions” around notmuch mail indexer that are too specific
to be added to http://notmuchmail.org/ wiki, with additional scripts
that aren't feasible to be stored to the wiki.

nottoomuch-addresses_

software
--------

nottoomuch-addresses_
  the address completion tool i use to complete email addresses
  when sending emails.

.. _nottoomuch-addresses: nottoomuch-addresses.rst

branches
--------

in addition to **master** branch i have **dogfood** branch where stuff
may not be as polished as in **master**, and **df-yymm** branch(es) with
same file content as **dogfood** branch. see branches.txt_ for more
information.

.. _branches.txt: branches.txt

contributing
------------

i accept patches in links to commit id, as pull requests and as in
patch emails provided by git-format-patch (and git-send-email).
i probably cherry-pick / rebase your stuff instead of merging (and
possivly do minor amends) so you have to manually close your pull
requests if you've done any.

see also branches.txt_ for reasons tho choose **master** or **df-yymm**
branch as a (re)base branch...
